Before we talk about Gumbel distribution, let's refresh our knowledge on exponential distribution. It is well-known that the exponential distribution is min-stable: the min of $$n$$ I.I.D. exponential random variables  $$X_i\sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_i), i=1,2,\ldots, n$$ is also exponentially distributed with decay rate $$\sum_{1\leq i\leq n} \lambda_i$$, as can be seen from the equation below.

$$
\begin{align*}
P(\min_{1\leq i \leq n} X_i > x) &= \prod_{1\leq i\leq n} P(X_i>x) = e^{-\sum_{1\leq i\leq n}\lambda_i x}
\end{align*}
$$

A lesser known property is that the arg-min of exponential variables is a multinomial distribution with event probabilities $$\left(\frac{\lambda_1}{\sum_{i}\lambda_i}, \ldots, \frac{\lambda_n}{\sum_{i}\lambda_i}\right)$$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&P(\arg\min_{1\leq i\leq n}X_i =k)\\
=&\int_0^\infty P(\arg\min_{1\leq i\leq n} X_i = x | X_k=x)f(X_k = x)dx\\
=&\int_0^\infty \prod_{i=1\to n, i\not=k} e^{-\lambda_i x} \lambda_k e^{-\lambda_k x} dx\\
=&\frac{\lambda_k}{\sum_{i=1\to n} \lambda_i}.
\end{align*}
$$

As we will see shortly, this property directly leads to the Gumbel max trick.

Assume that we are given a multinomial (a.k.a. categorical) distribution with unnormalized event probabilities $$\lambda_i, i=1\to n$$ (i.e., $$\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\not=1$$), the above property provides us a way to sample from the distribution without the need for normalization:
1. draw $$n$$ samples from an exponential distributions with decay rate of $$1$$
2. scale the value of these $$n$$ samples with $$1/\lambda_i$$ for $$i=1\to n$$.
3. take the index of the minimum of the scaled samples

To be more precise, we are utilizing the fact that

$$
\begin{align*}
&\arg\min_{1\leq i\leq n} \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_i}s_i\right) \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(\frac{\lambda_1}{\sum_{i}\lambda_i}, \ldots, \frac{\lambda_n}{\sum_{i}\lambda_i}\right)\\
&\text{where } s_i\sim \text{Exp}(1), \forall i.
\end{align*}
$$

For the case of soft-max operation, we have direct access to the log of the unnormalized probabilities $$\alpha_i=\log \lambda_i$$ (multinomial logit), instead of the unnormalized probabilities itself. In this case, we can modify the above equation as below

$$
\begin{align*}
&\arg\min_{1\leq i\leq n} \left(\frac{1}{e^{\alpha_i}}s_i\right) \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(\frac{e^{\alpha_1}}{\sum_{i}e^{\alpha_i}}, \ldots, \frac{e^{\alpha_n}}{\sum_{i}e^{\alpha_i}}\right)\\
&\text{where } s_i\sim \text{Exp}(1), \forall i.
\end{align*}
$$

One observation is that the left hand side of the above equation is invariant to any linear transform. The Gumbel-max trick is obtained by taking $$-\log(\cdot)$$ operation to the right-hand-side, in which case $$-\log(\text{Exp}(1))$$ is a standard Gumbel distribution, leading to the equation below  

$$
\begin{align*}
&\arg\max_{1\leq i\leq n} \left(\alpha_i+g_i\right) \sim \text{Multinomial}\left(\frac{e^{\alpha_1}}{\sum_{i}e^{\alpha_i}}, \ldots, \frac{e^{\alpha_n}}{\sum_{i}e^{\alpha_i}}\right)\\
&\text{where } g_i\sim \text{Gumbel}(\text{location}=0, \text{scale}=1), \forall i.
\end{align*}
$$

This provides us a way to obtain samples directly from the logits without going through the exponentiate-and-normalization step

1. draw $$n$$ samples from a standard Gumbel distributions with location of $$0$$ and scale of $$1$$.
2. add the values of the $$n$$ samples to the logits.
3. take the index of the minimum of the $$n$$ summations.

Essentially, *the Gumbel max trick converts the sampling operation from a categorical/multinomial distribution into an argmax operation*. The sampling process can be expedited if we pre-calculate and store a stream of Gumbel samples.
